In this simulation, two LANs connected to a DHCP server are shown, each dynamically associating an IP address to each host connected to the switch. In the second LAN also shows a DNS server to which a record has been associated with a respective IP address (in this case the same as the server) The two LANs are connected by two routers that allow communication and visibility between them respectively thanks to static routing tables
