This simulation shows how subnetting works between different LANs that require a certain number of hosts. We will start from an initial address that will have N number of available IPs which will then be subnetted to describe the needs of the LAN and how many hosts and free IPs it needs All this starting from a router starts connected to another router in turn connected to the LANs we will need.
